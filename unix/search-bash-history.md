When you run a command in a bash shell, it gets stored in your ~/.bash_history file. You can search this history with `CTRL-r`. Type in part of a command, and bash will fill it in with an autocompleted command from the .bash_history. You can then press `CTRL-r` again to view another command, press enter to run the command again or use the arrow keys to edit the command.

```bash
~$ (reverse-i-search)`vim': vim readme.md `
```
