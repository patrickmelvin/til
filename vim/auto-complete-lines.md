Vim has a feature for automatically completing lines based on characters prior to the cursor on the line. Just enter insert mode and type the following key combinations.

```
<Ctrl-x> <Ctrl-l>
```

That will bring up a list of possible completions that you can select from, which are based on configured completion sources. By default, this is the currently loaded buffer, as well as any loaded buffers.
